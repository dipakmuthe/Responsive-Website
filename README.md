Beginner Responsive Website Projects
<br>

This repository contains a collection of beginner-level responsive websites created for practice and learning purposes. As I am just starting out with web development, these projects focus on the basics of HTML, CSS, and responsive design. The websites are designed to adapt seamlessly across different screen sizes and devices.
<br>
Each project serves as an experiment to improve my skills and understanding of web design principles, with a focus on layout techniques, mobile-first design, and ensuring that websites are user-friendly on various platforms.
<br>
Feel free to explore, give feedback, and contribute to my journey as I continue to grow as a web developer!
